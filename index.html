With this, even those with just a spark of hardware can contribute to a safe AI, preempting the risk of a hard takeoff.`,
            paragraphTwo: `As we navigate the labyrinth of AI creation, we at ClosedAI champion perpetual openness. 'Closed' in ClosedAI is a playful paradox because our doors are always open, ensuring that the bounties of AI are in the hands of everyone from the very beginning. It's more than okay to share the lexicon of our scienceâ€”it's essential. Open-sourcing isn't just a fleeting strategy for us; it's our steadfast commitment, fortifying the global community for the long haul, progressing humanity onwards to becoming a type II civilization on the Kardashev scale.`,
